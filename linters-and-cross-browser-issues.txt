Linters I used for this project:

w3c-validation HTML 5

linter-styleint

w3c-validation CSS3



Issues I found during cross-browser testing:

- On the Contact page, is a little bit slow with images 

- For the Work page, is pretty cool with most of the Browser expect Chrome

- With phone/Handy ..the images are slow to load 

- Safari showed "Site not secure" errors while the other browers didn't
